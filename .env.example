# OAuth Configuration (Firebase Console Setup Required)
# ============================================
#
# To enable OAuth sign-in providers, you need to configure them in Firebase Console:
#
# 1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method
#
# 2. Enable the providers you want to use:
#    - Google: Enable and authorize domains (no additional credentials needed)
#    - Apple: Enable, add Service ID, Team ID, Key ID, and upload private key
#    - Facebook: Enable, add Facebook App ID and App Secret from developers.facebook.com
#
# 3. Add authorized domains:
#    - For local development: localhost
#    - For production: your-domain.com
#
# Note: The OAuth credentials are managed in Firebase Console.
# No additional environment variables are required for Google sign-in.
# Apple and Facebook may require additional setup in their respective developer portals.
